Overview
========

The agent, or more accurately the call centre agent or phone agent, works for a company and takes calls with private or business customers on their behalf.
In general, the place of work is a call centre, where a number of agents are employed. The operator of the call centre may be the company itself or an external service provider. Independent service providers often serve a whole range of different customers from a single site.

Call to agent
-------------
The agent can have multiple addresses. So, when the VoIPBIN makes a call to agents, it will generate calls to every agent's address. And if the agent answers one of the calls, then the other calls will hang up immediately.
