Overview
========
The activeflow is a dynamic entity that represents the running state of a registered flow. When the flow is executed, it creates an activeflow that contains an action cursor and status information. This activeflow provides a control interface that can be used to manage the flow execution.

In short, the activeflow is a powerful concept that enables the efficient and flexible execution of registered flows.

By providing a dynamic activeflow entity that represents the current state of the flow, along with a rich set of status and control features, it offers a valuable tool for managing complex workflows and automating business processes. The stop functionality allows users to quickly and easily halt the flow execution if necessary, adding an extra level of control and flexibility to the process.

Execution
--------------------
The activeflow is a powerful tool for managing complex workflows and automating business processes. By representing the current state of the flow as it progresses through its various stages, the activeflow provides valuable insights into the status of the flow and enables efficient management of its execution.

Status and Control interface
----------------------------
The activeflow includes status information that can be used to monitor the progress of the flow execution. This information may include details about the current state of the activeflow, such as which actions have been completed and which are still pending. The activeflow also provides a control interface that enables users to manage the activeflow execution. This interface can be used to stop the activeflow at any time, as well as to modify its configuration or parameters.
