Overview
========
The billing account feature in Voipbin empowers customers with better control over their account balance, enhancing the user experience and ensuring smooth communication. By programmatically verifying their account balance before initiating calls, customers can effectively manage their funds and ensure successful call completions.

Balance add
-----------
It's important to note that the balance add feature is exclusive to users with admin permissions. Regular users do not have the capability to add balance to their accounts programmatically. This safeguard ensures that the account balance remains secure and under the control of authorized personnel, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse.

Rate
----
Currently, Voipbin operates on a fixed-rate system, offering transparent and predictable pricing for various services. The table below outlines the costs associated with different services:

=================== ======================

=================== ======================

Please note that these rates are subject to change and are applicable to the current pricing structure. Voipbin strives to provide competitive rates while delivering high-quality services to its customers.
