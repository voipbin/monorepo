Overview
========

The flow is a set of instructions you can use to tell VoIPBIN what to do when you receive an incoming call.

How the flow works
--------------

When someone makes a call to one of your VoIPBIN numbers or destinations, VoIPBIN looks up the URL associated with that phone number and sends it a request.
VoIPBIN then reads the Flow instructions to determine what to do, whether it's recording the call, playing a message for the caller, or prompting the caller to press digits on their keypad.

At its core, Flow is an array of json objects with special tags defined by VoIPBIN to help you build your Programmable Voice application.
