- Queue: Represents the waiting place for calls and groups of agents who handle the calls.
- Outdial: Contains the list of target destinations to which the campaign will reach out.
- Outplan: Specifies the dialing strategy, determining how and when the calls will be initiated.

5W1H

The campaign adheres to the 5W1H principle, which focuses on answering specific questions for each resource:

- Campaign: Defines the purpose of making calls and outlines the actions to be taken after a call is established (Why/What).
- Queue (Agents): Identifies the agents or recipients who will receive the call after it is answered (Who).
- Outdial: Specifies the destinations or recipients to whom the calls will be made (Where).
- Outplan: Determines the approach and timing for making the calls (How/When).
