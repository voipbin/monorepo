Overview
========
A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, typically over messaging platforms. Chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to understand and interpret user requests, and then respond with appropriate information or actions.

Chatbots can be used for a variety of tasks, such as answering customer inquiries, providing support and guidance, making reservations, or even just for entertainment. They can be implemented on websites, messaging apps, social media platforms, and other digital channels, and can help to streamline customer service and support processes by providing quick and accurate responses to common questions and issues.

In the VoIPBin, you can set your chatbot and connect the call to the chatbot. So you can implement the voice chatbot talk easily.
