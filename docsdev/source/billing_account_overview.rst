Overview
========
The billing account feature in Voipbin allows customers to have better control over their account balance. With this feature, customers can programmatically verify their account balance before initiating calls. By checking the balance beforehand, customers can ensure that they have sufficient funds to successfully complete their calls.

Balance add
-----------
Please note that the balance add feature is restricted to users with admin permissions only. Regular users do not have the ability to add balance to their accounts programmatically. This limitation ensures that the account balance remains secure and under the control of authorized personnel.
