Overview
========

The VoIPBin's Trunk service could be divided into trunking and registration.

Trunking is a voice-over internet protocol (VoIP) technology that allows businesses to make and receive phone calls over the internet using a SIP (session initiation protocol) provider. Rather than relying on traditional phone lines, SIP trunking enables voice communication through the internet, making it a more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solution for businesses of all sizes. With SIP trunking, businesses can connect their existing phone systems to a SIP provider, which routes calls to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and other SIP-enabled devices, such as IP phones, softphones, and mobile devices. This technology can help businesses reduce their communication costs, improve call quality, and enhance their overall communication capabilities.

Registration is a process by which a user or device identifies itself to a server or service to gain access to its features or resources. In telephony and VoIP systems, registration is typically used to establish a connection between a user's device and a service provider, such as a SIP trunking provider or a PBX (private branch exchange) system. During the registration process, the user's device sends its identification information, such as a username, password, and IP address, to the service provider. The service provider then verifies the information and grants access to the user's device, allowing it to make and receive calls over the network. Registration is an essential step in establishing secure and reliable communication between devices and service providers, and it is a key aspect of many telephony and VoIP systems.

In short, trunking is needed for the making a call, and the registration is needed for the a receiving a call.
