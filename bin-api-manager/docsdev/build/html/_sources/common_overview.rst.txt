Overview
========

This section covers common data structures, patterns, and concepts used throughout the VoIPBIN API. Understanding these foundational elements will help you work more effectively with all VoIPBIN resources.

Common Data Structures
----------------------

Address Structure
+++++++++++++++++
The Address structure is used throughout VoIPBIN to represent communication endpoints, including phone numbers, SIP addresses, and extension numbers. See the detailed structure documentation at :ref:`here <common-struct-address-address>`.

Timestamp Format
++++++++++++++++
All timestamps in VoIPBIN follow the format ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.microseconds`` and are in UTC timezone unless otherwise specified.

Example: ``2022-05-01 15:10:38.785510878``

UUID Format
+++++++++++
VoIPBIN uses UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) to identify resources. All resource IDs follow the standard UUID v4 format.

Example: ``d9d32881-12fd-4b19-a6b2-6d5b6b6acf76``

Empty UUID
++++++++++
The empty UUID ``00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`` is used to represent null or unset references.

Common Patterns
---------------

Pagination
++++++++++
List endpoints support pagination using the ``next_page_token`` parameter. When a response includes a ``next_page_token`` field, pass this value in your next request to retrieve the next page of results.

Filtering and Searching
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Many list endpoints support filtering and searching through query parameters. Check the specific endpoint documentation for available filter options.

Soft Deletion
+++++++++++++
VoIPBIN uses soft deletion for most resources. Deleted resources have their ``tm_delete`` timestamp set but remain in the database. This allows for audit trails and potential recovery.
