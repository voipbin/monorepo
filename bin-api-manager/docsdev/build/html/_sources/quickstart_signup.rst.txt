To use the VoIPBin production API, you need your own account. You can also request access directly from the `admin console login page <https://admin.voipbin.net>`_ by clicking **Request access**.

Request an Account
------------------
Send a sign-up request email to:

**sungtae@voipbin.net**

Include the following details:

- Your name or organization name.
- Contact information.
- A brief description of how you plan to use VoIPBin.

**Note:** VoIPBin is currently a personal project. Automatic account creation is not available at this time, so all requests are handled manually.

What Happens Next
------------------
Once your request is processed, you will receive an email with:

- **Username**: Your account username.
- **Password**: A secure password to access your account.

Keep these credentials secure. You will use them to log in to the `admin console <https://admin.voipbin.net>`_ and to authenticate API requests.
