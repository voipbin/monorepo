Ovewview
========
sdk is a software development kit that provides a set of tools and libraries that developers can use to create applications for a specific platform or framework. The SDK includes a set of APIs that allow developers to interact with the platform or framework, as well as documentation and sample code to help developers get started. SDKs are often used to simplify the development process and provide developers with the tools they need to build applications quickly and efficiently.

Acesskey
--------
Most of the APIs in the SDK require an access key to authenticate the user and authorize access to the platform or framework. 
The access key is a unique identifier that is used to identify the user and grant access to the platform or framework. 
Developers can obtain an access key by registering for an account on the platform or framework's website and generating an access key through the developer portal.

See detail about the accesskey :ref:`here <accesskey-overview>`.
