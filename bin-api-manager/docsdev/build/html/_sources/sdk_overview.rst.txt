Overview
========
The VoIPBIN SDK (Software Development Kit) provides a set of tools and libraries that developers can use to create communication applications using the VoIPBIN platform. The SDK includes client libraries that wrap the VoIPBIN REST API, making it easier to integrate VoIPBIN's capabilities into your applications without dealing with low-level HTTP requests.

SDKs simplify the development process by providing:

* Type-safe API methods with auto-completion support
* Built-in error handling and retry logic
* Automatic request/response serialization
* Authentication management
* Comprehensive documentation and code examples

Accesskey
---------
Most of the APIs in the SDK require an access key to authenticate the user and authorize access to the platform or framework. 
The access key is a unique identifier that is used to identify the user and grant access to the platform or framework. 
Developers can obtain an access key by registering for an account on the platform or framework's website and generating an access key through the developer portal.

See detail about the accesskey :ref:`here <accesskey-overview>`.

Support Languages
