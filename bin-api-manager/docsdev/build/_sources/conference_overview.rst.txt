Overview
========
The Conference API is a powerful low-level API that empowers developers to create conference rooms capable of accommodating various forms of communication, including voice, video, and chat. At its core, the API revolves around the concept of conferences, which act as containers for communications exchanged between two or more users. These communications may represent single interactions or a complete history of all interactions between the participants.

Additionally, the Conference API allows developers to establish voice, video, and WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) calls, enabling seamless voice and video communication between two users. These calls can be stored within the conferences, ensuring that all relevant communications are organized and easily accessible.

By leveraging the Conference API, developers can build robust communication applications with the capability to host multi-user conferences and support various communication modes. The API's flexibility and functionality provide a foundation for creating feature-rich and scalable communication solutions to meet diverse user needs. Whether for collaboration, remote meetings, customer support, or any other scenario requiring real-time communication, the Conference API offers a reliable and efficient means to establish and manage communication sessions between multiple users.
