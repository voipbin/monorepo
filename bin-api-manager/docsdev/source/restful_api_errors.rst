Error Reason Codes
==================

.. note:: **AI Context**

   Every 4xx/5xx response from the VoIPbin API contains an ``error.reason`` field in ``UPPER_SNAKE`` that identifies the specific cause. This page catalogues all published reasons grouped by ``domain``. Clients should branch on ``reason`` for self-healing behavior. ``status`` maps 1:1 to HTTP (see :doc:`restful_api`).

   Reason codes are append-only once published. Adding a new reason does not require a schema version bump; removing or renaming one does and triggers a deprecation window.

   * - Reason
     - HTTP
     - Cause → Fix
   * - ``AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED``
     - 401
     - No token or access key was supplied. Send a valid JWT in the ``Authorization: Bearer ...`` header, or a valid access key.
   * - ``INVALID_CREDENTIALS``
     - 401
     - The supplied token or access key is invalid or expired. Refresh the token via ``POST https://api.voipbin.net/v1.0/auth/login`` and retry.
   * - ``ACCOUNT_FROZEN``
     - 403
     - The customer account is frozen (typically because unregister was scheduled). Inspect ``error.details[0].recovery_endpoint`` and call it to restore the account, or wait past ``deletion_effective_at``.
   * - ``PERMISSION_DENIED``
     - 403
     - The authenticated user does not have permission for this resource.
   * - ``DIRECT_ACCESS_NOT_SUPPORTED``
     - 403
     - The endpoint requires a JWT login flow that the current direct access (access key) cannot satisfy. Re-authenticate via JWT.
   * - ``RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED``
     - 429
     - Client exceeded the rate limit for this endpoint. Back off and retry with exponential delay.
   * - ``RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND``
     - 404
     - The requested resource does not exist or does not belong to the authenticated customer. Verify the UUID was obtained from a recent ``GET`` list call.
   * - ``ROUTE_NOT_FOUND``
     - 404
     - The requested HTTP endpoint does not exist (wrong path or typo). Verify the URL against the API reference; check API version prefix (``/v1.0/``) and resource name.
   * - ``INVALID_ARGUMENT``
     - 400
     - The request body or a path/query parameter is invalid. Inspect ``error.message`` for details.
   * - ``INVALID_JSON_BODY``
     - 400
     - The request body is not valid JSON. Ensure ``Content-Type`` is ``application/json`` and the payload parses as a JSON object or array.
   * - ``INVALID_ID``
     - 400
     - A path or body parameter is not a valid UUID. Verify the ID was obtained from a recent ``GET`` list call and has the form ``a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890``.
   * - ``REQUEST_TIMEOUT``
     - 503
     - Upstream manager did not respond within the deadline. Retry with the same idempotency key after a short delay.
   * - ``REQUEST_CANCELED``
     - 503
     - The request was canceled before completion (typically the client disconnected). Usually safe to ignore; the server did not finish processing.
   * - ``SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE``
     - 503
     - An upstream manager service is temporarily unavailable. Retry the request with the same idempotency key after a short delay (exponential backoff).
   * - ``INTERNAL``
     - 500
     - Unexpected server error. Include ``error.request_id`` when opening a support ticket.
