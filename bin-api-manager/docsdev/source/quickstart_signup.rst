In this Quickstart, you'll learn how to sign up and receive your account credentials to start using the VoIPBin API.

Sign up to VoIPBin
-------------------
To begin, send a sign-up request email to:

**pchero21@gmail.com**

Include the following details in your email:

- Your name or organization name.
- Contact information.
- A brief description of how you plan to use VoIPBin.

**Note:** VoIPBin is currently a personal project. Automatic account creation is not available at this time, so all requests are handled manually. Please allow some time for your request to be processed.

What Happens Next
------------------
Once your request is processed, you will receive an email with the following account credentials:

- **ID**: Your unique account identifier.
- **Password**: A secure password to access your account.

Keep these credentials secure, as they are required to log in and access VoIPBin services.

After receiving your account credentials, you can start exploring VoIPBin features. Begin with the tutorial guides to understand how to configure and use the API effectively.
