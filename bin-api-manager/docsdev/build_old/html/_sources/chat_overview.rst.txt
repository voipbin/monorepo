Overview
========
The VoIPBIN's chat API offers a reliable chat service designed to facilitate seamless message communication between agents. This feature ensures efficient and real-time interactions, enabling quick and effective communication within the organization.

Chat and Chatroom
-----------------
The chat functionality allows agents to exchange messages with one another, fostering collaborative teamwork and enhancing internal communication. Agents can engage in one-on-one chat sessions, enabling private conversations that are secure and tailored to specific topics or discussions. Additionally, chatroom functionality provides a group chat environment, allowing multiple agents to participate in discussions related to shared projects, tasks, or team-wide announcements.

Chatmessage and Charoommessage
------------------------------
The Chatmessage represents individual messages exchanged during one-on-one chats, enabling agents to share information, coordinate tasks, or seek assistance from colleagues.

On the other hand, the Chatroommessage represents messages within a chatroom, facilitating real-time conversations among multiple agents. These messages contribute to productive team discussions, brainstorming sessions, and collaborative decision-making processes.

By leveraging the Chat API and its Chatmessage and Chatroommessage features, organizations can streamline internal communication, enhance team collaboration, and foster a more connected and productive work environment. The chat service plays a vital role in improving workflow efficiency and ensuring that agents have a reliable platform for instant communication and information sharing.
