Key Features and Use Cases
--------------------------
Agent Skills: Tags are commonly used to represent the skills and expertise of agents. By assigning relevant tags to agents, call centers can ensure that incoming calls are routed to the most qualified agents capable of handling specific types of inquiries or issues. This helps improve customer satisfaction and reduces call handling times.

Team Assignment: Tags can be used to group agents into teams based on their roles, departments, or locations. This allows call centers to implement specialized teams for handling different types of calls or catering to specific customer segments.

Call Routing: When a call comes into the call center, the routing system can use the tags associated with the queue and the available agents to determine the most suitable agent to handle the call. This dynamic routing based on tags ensures efficient call distribution and better utilization of resources.

Reporting and Analytics: Tags provide valuable data for reporting and analytics purposes. Call centers can track the performance of agents or teams based on specific tags and gain insights into call volumes, call durations, and other key metrics.

Flexibility and Customization: The Tag API offers great flexibility in how tags can be used and applied. Users can create custom tags that align with their specific business needs and adapt them as requirements evolve.
