# VoIPbin Monorepo

Welcome to the VoIPBin monorepo — the unified backend codebase that powers all VoIPBin services.

VoIPBin is a cloud-native, scalable CPaaS platform designed for modern voice communication. This repository provides all the backend components for managing users, routing calls, handling media, running chatbots, and more — all in a single place.

This repository is a **monorepo** for all VoIPbin backend services. It provides a unified development environment for managing the services that power the VoIPbin platform.

## 🧱 Why a Monorepo?

VoIPBin uses a **monorepo** to manage all backend services in a single codebase. This approach is intentional and comes with many advantages:

### ✅ Benefits

- **Single source of truth**: All services live in one place, ensuring consistency and traceability.
- **Easier refactoring**: Shared logic and APIs can be updated across services without versioning headaches.
- **Shared tooling**: Common CI/CD pipelines, Go versioning, linting, and codegen setup apply to all modules.
- **Simplified onboarding**: New developers only need to clone one repo to access the entire system.
- **Better visibility**: Understanding the system as a whole becomes easier when everything is in one place.

## 🔍 What is VoIPbin?

VoIPbin is a **VoIP backend platform** designed to help teams quickly deploy and operate communication workflows — from simple call routing to AI-assisted conversation flows.

Think of it as **Twilio meets self-hosting**, with a focus on flexibility, modularity, and full control over your stack.

### Use cases include:

- Building programmable call flows
- Running AI-powered callbots or IVRs
- Handling mass outbound call campaigns
- Creating scalable conferencing tools
- Integrating SMS, Email, and Webhooks
- Recording, transcribing, and summarizing calls
- Managing VoIP customers, agents, and usage

## 🛠️ How to Get Started

> ⚠️ VoIPbin is not a plug-and-play application.
> 
> It's a platform composed of multiple microservices, SIP/media infrastructure (e.g., Asterisk, RTPEngine), Kubernetes-based deployments, and cloud integrations (e.g., Twilio, OpenAI). You don't just "run it" — you assemble and deploy it based on your architecture.

This monorepo handles only part of voipbin services.

![VoIPBin Architecture](architecture_overview_all.png)


That said, here's how to begin:

### Understand the Architecture

VoIPbin is composed of multiple services that run independently and communicate over HTTP, gRPC, SIP, and WebRTC. You’ll need:

* A Kubernetes environment (we recommend GCP GKE)
* Compute engine with static public IP Address
* A public domain with TLS (e.g., via Cloudflare)
* A media path (RTPEngine or equivalent)
* Optionally, Asterisk instances for call bridging, conferencing, and SIP registration

We recommend reading the platform architecture guide (coming soon) before setup.

### Clone the Repo

```
   $ git clone https://github.com/your-org/voipbin.git
   $ cd voipbin
```

### Configure Your Secrets

```
export CC_AUTHTOKEN_OPENAI=xxx
export CC_TWILIO_TOKEN=xxx
export CC_SSL_CERT_API_BASE64=xxx
...
```
Check each service’s README (or environment loader) for what it needs.

### Deploy to Kubernetes
You'll need a Kubernetes manifest or Helm chart per service. For now, these are maintained privately or in internal repositories — contact us if you'd like access to deployment blueprints.
