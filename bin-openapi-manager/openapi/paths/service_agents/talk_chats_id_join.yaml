  summary: Join a talk chat
  description: |
    Allows the authenticated agent to join a "talk" type chat (public channel).
    This is a convenience endpoint that automatically adds the agent as a participant.
    Only works for "talk" type chats - for group/direct chats, use the participants endpoint.
