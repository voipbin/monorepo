  summary: Create a new customer account (self-service signup).
  description: |
    Initiates a new customer account registration. The request must include `accepted_tos: true`
    to confirm Terms of Service agreement.

    On success, returns a customer object and a temporary token. On failure (e.g., duplicate email),
    still returns HTTP 200 with an empty body to prevent email enumeration attacks.

    After signup, the customer receives a verification email. Use `POST /auth/email-verify` with the
    token from the email to verify the account.

        Signup initiated successfully, or silently ignored if the email already exists (to prevent enumeration).
        On success, the response contains the customer object and a temporary token.

        Bad request. Possible causes:
        - `accepted_tos` is `false` or missing.
        - `email` is missing.
        - Request body is malformed JSON.
